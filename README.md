*Threes!* is a popular tile-sliding game released in 2014 for [iOS](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/threes!-free/id976851174) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=vo.threes.free). It was designed by [Asher Vollmer](https://ashervollmer.tumblr.com/home) and [Greg Wohlwend](https://aeiowu.com), and its music was composed by Jimmy Hinson ([Big Giant Circles](https://biggiantcircles.bandcamp.com)).

The game consists of a 4x4 grid, where there may be a numbered tile in each slot. During the game, one "moves" the grid by swiping up, down, left, or right: all tiles on the grid will move in this direction (if possible), merging tiles of the same value into tiles of double the value. After each move, a new tile spawns on the edge opposite the direction of movement. The game ends when no further moves are possible; the grid is then scored based on the sum of the point values of each tile.

Many other games have been created with mechanics based on this game; one very popular example is [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) by Gabriele Cirulli.
